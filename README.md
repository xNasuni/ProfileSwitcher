# ProfileSwitcher

**ProfileSwitcher** is a utility for the browser **Opera GX** that allows you to change between the profiles you want links to automatically open.

> This utilizes the registry in order to change the registry key for the main opera gx and simple file reading to get the list of profiles you currently have.

## Extra Information

> **ProfileSwitcher** only changes one registry key and only reads your Opera GX profile data.
> The registry key and the directory it reads is mentioned below.
> ```
> Registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Opera GXStable\shell\open\command
> Files    %AppData%\Opera Software\Opera GX Stable\_side_profiles
> ```

### Todo
> I am working on a way to make this still work if you've installed Opera GX for all users and also if you come across any bugs please report this issue on this github page.
